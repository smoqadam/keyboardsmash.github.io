      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s approach today differently.
Let&amp;rsquo;s be mindful.
Let&amp;rsquo;s not worry about the future.
Whenever our minds wander, let&amp;rsquo;s bring them back to the present moment.
Let&amp;rsquo;s love.
Let&amp;rsquo;s smile.</description>

      <description>Steps towards a dream Since moving to Germany, I have struggled to find a long-term goal to guide my daily actions. My dream of living abroad, particularly in Germany, had been with me since my early twenties, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until my late twenties that I committed to making it a reality. To prepare for this move, I left my hometown and spent time in Tehran, where I gained valuable experience working in technology companies and tested my ability to live independently in a different city while dealing with the challenges that come with it.</description>

      <description>In terms of reading, 2021 was a productive year for me. I read several books, here is the list of those that I loved most.
Outliers: The Story of Success When the books I had ordered online were delivered to me, I saw the Outliers were also in the package. I was disappointed because I hadn’t ordered this, and after contacting the seller, he said he mistakenly put this book instead of another book that I’d ordered.</description>

      <title>On Being Human</title>

      <description>The human being is a strange species. A creature that has been around for a few million years and since the beginning has been trying to find its way through evolution by its intelligence. Being smart helped us overcome many difficulties, and being selfish made it easier for us to destroy everything to be more dominant. Although we call ourselves the most intelligent species on earth, yet it takes us a few years to learn to walk and interact with other human beings.</description>

      <title>To remember during the bad days</title>

      <description>It won&amp;rsquo;t last.
You have felt other things. You will feel other things again.
Emotions are like weather. They change and shift. Clouds can seem as still as stone. We look at them and hardly notice a change at all. And yet they always move.
The worst part of any experience is the part where you feel like you can&amp;rsquo;t take it any more. So, if you feel like you can&amp;rsquo;t take it any more, the chances are you are already at the worst point.</description>

      <description>I don’t know why, but for me doing the dishes is one the worst aspect of life, especially when you have to do it after one of the best aspects of life, eating. Since I’ve been struggling to wash the dishes as soon as I use them, the result has always been a sink full of dirty and stinky dishes.
I have tried many ways to overcome this laziness. One of those ways is to look at it as an act of mindfulness.</description>

      <description>you can focus your energy exclusively on solving problems, rather than reacting to them. When you worry, ask yourself, What am I choosing to not see right now? We are A-to-Z thinkers, fretting about A, obsessing over Z, yet forgetting all about B through Y. Think progress, not perfection. Okay, you’ve got to do something very difficult. Don’t focus on that. Instead break it down into pieces. Simply do what you need to do right now.</description>

      <title>Man&#39;s Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl - Highlights</title>
      <link>https://keyboardsmash.dev/posts/mans-search-for-meaning-highlights/</link>

      <description>Nietzsche: “He who has a Why to live for, can bear almost any How.” Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person), and in courage during diffcult times.</description>

      <description>In March 2020, the government announced a lockdown. No one allows to go out except for shopping, and everyone must work from home. First of all, despite of the hard situation for every business, I was lucky that I didn’t get laid off and my salary remained untouched.
After a few days of passing time at home, playing video games, and watching movies, I felt guilty that I’m not as productive as I should be and I’m not using my time efficiently.</description>

      <title>How to write a PHP Youtube video downloader</title>
      <link>https://keyboardsmash.dev/posts/how-download-youtube-videos-by-php/</link>

      <description>PHP is not the best language for writing a download manager, but in this article, we are going to learn how we can download videos from Youtube. Because PHP does not support multithreading, we cannot make a proper download manager that split the file into several chunks and download it concurrently. There are some ways to add multithreading to PHP, but for the sake of this article, we won&amp;rsquo;t go through those ways and will stick to single threading.</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, when we are talking about web development, regardless of the type of application or the programming language, one of the first things that come to mind is how to authenticate users. There are many types of authentication ways for this purpose such as login form, oAuth, JWT, API token, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliability, security, easy to use and widely supported in many platform and languages make JWT one of the most popular authentication protocols in the web ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement JWT in Symfony 5 by using the &lt;strong&gt;firebase/php-jwt&lt;/strong&gt; package and AbstractGuardAuthenticator class. There are some bundles or packages already out there like &lt;strong&gt;lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle&lt;/strong&gt; that we can use but at the end of this tutorial, we will learn how can we implement and use Authentication Guard which in Symfony.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Loneliness can’t hurt you, if you don’t want Actually, I learned it a couple of years ago, but sometimes you can forget about something important so much that maybe it will not hurt you.</description>

      <description>How you deploy your projects? Are you using fancy things like Jenkins with lots of features and configuration that you don&amp;rsquo;t even know about? For one of my personal projects, I needed to have a deployment tools. I tried to install and configure Jenkins but there was no chance to make it up and running. So I decided to write my own, simple deployer with PHP.
