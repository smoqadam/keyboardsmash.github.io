You have felt other things. You will feel other things again.
Emotions are like weather. They change and shift. Clouds can seem as still as stone. We look at them and hardly notice a change at all. And yet they always move.
The worst part of any experience is the part where you feel like you can&rsquo;t take it any more. So, if you feel like you can&rsquo;t take it any more, the chances are you are already at the worst point.">
