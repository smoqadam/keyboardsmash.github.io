      <description>In the previous article, we explored how base64 encoding works and successfully implemented it in Rust. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s delve into the process of decoding a base64-encoded string. It is important to note that the implementations discussed here are primarily for educational purposes, and for production environments, it is recommended to employ well-established libraries.
Theory Here are the steps to decode a base64-encoded string:
Split the string into groups of 4 characters.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning Rust on and off for quite a some time and every time I pick it up again I learn something new. A few days ago when I came back to it again, I was looking for a educational project to do and I decided to implement the Base64 algorithm in Rust. In this post, I will explain how to encode data to base64 in Rust. Decoding from base64 will be covered in a separate blog post, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth practicing by implementing it yourself.</description>
