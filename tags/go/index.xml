      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my journey to learn Go, I decided to start write about the topics that I&amp;rsquo;m learning. This technique known as Feynman Learning Technique. I have done this long time ago when I wanted to learn PHP, I started a blog in Persian, and start to write about everything I was learning about PHP. These articles might not be useful for experienced programmers, but it helps me to have a deep understanding about the stuff I&amp;rsquo;m going to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I want to write a simple deployer by using Github Webhooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, please let me know if you find any issues or mistakes. We can disscuss about it and we can learn together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
