      <description>In terms of reading, 2021 was a productive year for me. I read several books, here is the list of those that I loved most.
Outliers: The Story of Success When the books I had ordered online were delivered to me, I saw the Outliers were also in the package. I was disappointed because I hadn’t ordered this, and after contacting the seller, he said he mistakenly put this book instead of another book that I’d ordered.</description>

      <description>It won&amp;rsquo;t last.
You have felt other things. You will feel other things again.
Emotions are like weather. They change and shift. Clouds can seem as still as stone. We look at them and hardly notice a change at all. And yet they always move.
The worst part of any experience is the part where you feel like you can&amp;rsquo;t take it any more. So, if you feel like you can&amp;rsquo;t take it any more, the chances are you are already at the worst point.</description>

      <description>you can focus your energy exclusively on solving problems, rather than reacting to them. When you worry, ask yourself, What am I choosing to not see right now? We are A-to-Z thinkers, fretting about A, obsessing over Z, yet forgetting all about B through Y. Think progress, not perfection. Okay, you’ve got to do something very difficult. Don’t focus on that. Instead break it down into pieces. Simply do what you need to do right now.</description>

      <description>Nietzsche: “He who has a Why to live for, can bear almost any How.” Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person), and in courage during diffcult times.</description>
